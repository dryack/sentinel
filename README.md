sentinel
========

CLI tool that uses PagerDuty to alert the user when a command is complete.


Almost from day one of my career in Ops, I spent a fair amount of time working on Cassandra,
often performing tasks that took a long and uncertain time to complete, but needed followup
immediately after they returned.  Often this meant staying up late, constantly checking on
the progress of the command.  I longed for a way to detect the completion of these commands,
that would allow me to sleep or be more heavily engaged in other things.
